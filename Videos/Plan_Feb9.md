Alright, in my last email I mentioned that I think it'd be smart to build off the tokens of the localytics page, as they seem to be quite controlled and they are are already up and running. I don't have those and I don't have github access to have Claude pull styles the format of the styles you're using today, which limits how specific I can be in my recommendations.
