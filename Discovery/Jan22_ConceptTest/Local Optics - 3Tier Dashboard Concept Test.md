## Introduction

Thank you for joining today. I'm Sam, and I'd love to get your reaction to a direction we're considering for the proposed Local Optics multi-brand dashboard.

## Concept Test

1.  I'm going to send you a link to a few pictures that you a direction we're considering for a multi-brand dashboard. Could you open Chrome or Safari and share your screen?

2. **Link.** Let's make sure it displays properly. 

3.  I'll be intentionally quiet for a bit to let you explore, and then I'll as a few questions. If you click anywhere on the screen, you'll see just a few blue boxes that you can click on to explore. 


## Section 1: Multi-Brand View — PRIMARY FOCUS

*Show multi-brand overview screen*

"This is a new concept we're exploring. Take a moment to look at this screen. Please think aloud—tell me what you're seeing and what stands out to you as you see this for this first time."

*Allow 30-60 seconds of unprompted exploration*

### Open-ended reactions
- "Tell me about what you see here."
- "What's your initial reaction to this view?"

### Comprehension
- "Based on what you see here, which brand would you want to look into first? Why?"

### Relevance to workflow
- "How does this compare to how you monitor your brands today?"
- "Is there anything here that would change how you work?"
- "What information would you expect to act on from this view?"

### Exploration prompts
- "What would you want to do from here?" *(Let them click if they want—action dropdown, filter, location tab available)*

### Gap identification
- "Is anything missing that you'd want to see at this level?"
- "Is there anything here you wouldn't need?"

## Section 2: Multi-Location View

*Transition via Location tab or navigate to multi-location view*

"Now let's look at another view. Again, take a moment and tell me what you notice."

*Allow 30 seconds of unprompted exploration*

### Open-ended reactions
- "Tell me about what you see here." 
- "What's your initial reaction to this view?"

### Comprehension
- "If you needed to find a location that needs attention, how would you do that here?"

### Relevance
- "How does this compare to how you look at locations today?"

### Exploration
- "What would you do from here?" *(Filter drawer, click into location available)*

### Gap identification
- "Anything missing? Anything unnecessary?"

---

## Section 3: Single Location View

*Click into a single location*

"Now you're looking at a single location. Tell me what you see."

*Allow 30 seconds of unprompted exploration*

### Open-ended reactions
- "Tell me about what you see here." 
- "What's your initial reaction to this view?"

### Comprehension
- "If your manager asked 'how is this location doing?'—could you answer that from this screen?"
- "What's driving performance at this location, based on what you see?"

### Relevance
- "How does this compare to the location view you use today?"
- "What would you do first if you landed on this page?"

### Exploration
- "If you wanted to dig deeper into something, where would you go?"

### Gap identification
- "What else would you want to see here?"
- "Is there anything you'd remove or de-emphasize?"

---

## Wrap-Up 

To wrap up:

1. **Overall, what's your impression of what you saw today?**

2. **If you had to pick one thing that excited you, what would it be?**

3. **If you had to pick one thing that concerned you or felt missing, what would it be?**

4. **Anything else you want to share that we didn't cover?**

Thank you so much for your time and feedback. Incredibly helpful.

## Notes

### Things to listen for (related to early feedback themes)
Note if participant organically mentions any of these
- [ ] Wanting to hide/show/resize sections
- [ ] Calendar needing more visibility or data points
- [ ] Date range behavior expectations
- [ ] Wanting direct links to Geogrids for whole brand
- [ ] Credits/purchasing visibility
- [ ] "View All" for Geogrids or Keywords
- [ ] Reviews aggregation at brand level
- [ ] Change log / notifications placement

### Non-verbal cues (transcript misses)
- Where they looked first on screen
- Visible confusion or excitement
- Dismissive body language
- Hesitation / long pause

### Key validation questions (answer from observation)
1. Does the multi-brand view successfully direct attention to brands needing attention?
2. Does the multi-location view successfully direct attention to locations needing attention?
3. Does the single location view convey overall performance and its drivers?
4. Does the participant understand the data hierarchy (brand → location → detail)?

### User group insights to capture
- Daily/weekly workflow patterns
- Key metrics they care about
- Who they report to / who consumes their outputs
- Current pain points with existing tools
- Decision-making triggers (what makes them take action?)
